# Yelp Database
This project involves developing a Python-based application to interact with a Yelp database, allowing users to perform various tasks such as searching, modifying, and reviewing data. The application serves as a user-friendly interface to explore Yelp's business and user data while providing essential features to enhance user experience. The program supports both graphical and command-line interfaces and is designed to be easily testable on the CSIL workstations.
